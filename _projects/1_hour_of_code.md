Upon realizing the importance of exposing children from all backgrounds to technology, I began volunteering and organizing hour-of-code events in my childrenâ€™s schools. Together with other parents, I have taught scratch and code monkey coding by using engaging activities developed by [Wix](https://www.wix.com/about/us). You can find them [here](https://www.hourofcode.co.il/).

	Here are a few tips I would like to share: 

	<ul>
	   <li>It is very important to begin the lesson with a brief introduction to technology. Explain what it is and where we see it in our everyday lives. Children enjoy imagining new technologies when they are asked to do so. <a href="/al-folio/assets/pdf/hour_of_code.pdf">Here is an example presentation<a>.
	    <li>"The dance party" is an amazingly engaging activity. Suitable for children in the second through fourth grades. For first graders, it might be too challenging because they don't know how to read yet. Instead, I recommend "constructing and having fun".
	    <li>Having a diverse group of volunteer parents who provide children with various kinds of role models is important.
