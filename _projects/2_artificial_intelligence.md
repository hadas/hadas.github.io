Our children grow up in an automated world surrounded by various types of intelligent machines. It is beneficial to introduce artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts to children in order to raise their awareness of the changing world around them. 

I have prepared a presentation about machine learning for elementary school students. It starts with an introduction to basic concepts, then shows a detailed example of a books classification task. As I presented it to various groups of 
children, I found that children really enjoyed the book example and thought about their own features. The Hebrew version can be found <a href="/al-folio/assets/pdf/ML_amit.pdf">here</a>, and the English version <a href="/al-folio/assets/pdf/ML_amit_eng.pdf">here</a>.
